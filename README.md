# Introduction

The Flowplayer iOS SDK is a native media player, written entirely in Swift and provides an easy-to-use API which enables developers to create beautiful iOS applications that play audio and video
both locally and over the Internet. The Flowplayer iOS SDK uses AVPlayer as its core and therefore takes advantage of all its powerful features.

The SDK supports adaptive streaming technologies such as HLS, as well as the most popular single container formats, such as MP4, MP3, AVI, and several more.

## Migration from v2 to v3

**Module rename**

The main public module that needs to be imported to use Flowplayer SDK has been renamed from:
`FlowplayerCore` to `Flowplayer`. Now `FlowplayerCore` is an internal module and is used by `Flowplayer`
and should not be _used_ or _imported_.

```swift
// import FlowplayerCore << Remove
import Flowplayer
```

## __Installation__

### CocoaPods integration
Use the package manager [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) to install Flowplayer. Please make sure you have removed the old version of Flowplayer before upgrading to v3.

```bash
# PodFile
pod 'Flowplayer', '~> 3.0.3'
```

and the run

```bash
pod install
```
